## Potato Gnocchi

### Ingredients

- Potatoes
- Flour
- Egg

### How to make

- Put the potatoes to microwave for about 8 minutes.

- Using a peeler to remove the skin from the potatoes. In a medium bowl, mash the potatoes until all lumps are gone. Put them away to cold them down.

- Add salt, one beaten egg and flour into the bowl, then knead them into a dough.

- Sprinkle some flour onto the surface and then slice the dough into parts. Roll out 1 part into a long rope. Slice the rope into Â½-inch squares and set aside on a lightly floured surface. Repeat with the remaining dough.

- (Optional) If desired, place a fork on your work surface and slide each gnocchi square from the base of the fork prongs to the top so they make a decorative shape.

- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the gnocchi in batches, stirring gently once or twice to ensure they are not sticking. Boil until they float to the surface; after another 15-30 seconds in the water, remove.

- In a pan over medium heat, melt butter and add the sage. Add the gnocchi and toss until lightly golden.
